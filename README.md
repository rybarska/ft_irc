## ⚠️ Security Disclaimer

**This project (`ft_irc`) is for educational purposes only.**

Due to project constraints, including:

- ❌ No external libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, libsodium)
- ❌ No use of standard cryptographic tools
- ❌ No TLS/SSL for encrypted connections

it is **not possible** to implement secure authentication, password handling, or data transmission in a way that meets real-world security standards.

Any password storage, verification, or data transmission in this project should be considered **insecure** and vulnerable to common attacks (e.g., sniffing, spoofing, replay, brute force).

The focus of this project is on learning how IRC-like protocols and server/client architecture work — **not** on implementing production-grade security.
